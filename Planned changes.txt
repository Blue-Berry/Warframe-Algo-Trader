Initial problem is there is too much competition possible solutions:
1. Update bids more often
    - run a seperate loop that constantly updates orders
    - run the loop that adds items faster
    - check if its retaining connection rather than reconnecting every time
2. bid on more items
    - increase max possible plat cap
3. Bid on items that wouldn't be bid on by default (ie out of range for bidding etc)
    - play with the spread/liquidity values
