Initial problem is there is too much competition possible solutions:
1. Update bids more often
    - run a seperate loop that constantly updates orders
    - run the loop that adds items faster
    - check if its retaining connection rather than reconnecting every time
2. bid on more items
    - increase max possible plat cap
3. Bid on items that wouldn't be bid on by default (ie out of range for bidding etc)
    - play with the spread/liquidity values

Optomisation:
 * Main loop Optomisation
1. The loop reads from the `inventory` table twice, which could be reduced to a single read
2. The `interestingItems` list could be constructed less often.
3. The `getFilteredDF` function is called within the loop, which could be a bottleneck if it's a slow operation. If possible, it might be worth investigating ways to optimize this function or reduce the number of times it's called.
